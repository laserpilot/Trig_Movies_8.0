Trig_Movies_8.0
===============

My Visualist Max/MSP/Jitter patch that I used and maintained primarily from 2007 to 2011

Uses a lot of examples and other shaders that may not make it possible for it to run on your machine :( - lots of things and examples from Andrew Benson and HC Gilje and many other Jitter luminaries

Also includes lots of breakouts for my controllers including:
Korg Nanokontrol
Akai MPC30
Trigger Finger

Basically has a dual movie loader -> CPU effects -> GPU/OpenGL Shader Effects -> Quad Warp method going on
